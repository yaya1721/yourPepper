Mobile App Features
Social Media Time Manager: 
Pings the users constantly about the time spent on apps like IG, FB, YouTube, etc by narrating the important to-dos left in the schedule. Users will have the option to have their friends record voice messages for reminders to get a personal touch. The user will be able to choose between different modes/intensity:
Low: Just reminding the time spent in one use session. Pings after every 10-15 mins
Medium: Pings and asks if you want to leave the app immediately
High: Forcefully closes the app after a use session exceeds a given time duration like 15 mins
Uses Google Calendar to identify focus time periods like class or meeting and blocks all notifications from social media apps.
If the user is using apps during class or meeting, it’ll ping after every 4 mins and tell the user to focus on class or meeting


Positivity Manager:
Helps maintain a good mental and physical health of the user by constant reminders after class or long meetings to drink water, move around, stretch
